# Data-Visualization-Program

NTU Assignment Programming Project:

Tools required:

JavaScript
HTML
CSS
Chart.JS

Requirements:

- Provide TWO chart.js visualizations with appropriate prompts e.g. title, labels,
  legends, colours etc.

- Use data to create the charts, either hardcoded, from xml or database.

- Make the visualizations appropriately responsive (\*this is not the same as
  responsive web page)

- Utilise user inputs to update chart in real time (\*this is not updating the
  database but only the chart in realtime).

What I will do to meet those requirements:

- Aquire free data csv from Kaggle, convert it into a database scheme and extract that data to use for the project

- Create 2 charts , bubble and radar chart (radar chart for battery comparison , bubble chart price vs performance)

- Utilise Javascript , and tailwind to make the charts and the website responsive with real-time input changes.

- Create mutliple types of input, implementing a filter sidebar which includes: checkboxes, range sliders, sort buttons. Resert and apply buttons will also be different types of user inputs

- A page which will dsiplay each phone which the user can pcik from.
