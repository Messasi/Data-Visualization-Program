# Data-Visualization-Program

NTU Assignment Program

Project Requirements:

- Provide TWO chart.js visualizations with appropriate prompts e.g. title, labels,
  legends, colours etc.

- Use data to create the charts, either hardcoded, from xml or database.

- Make the visualizations appropriately responsive (\*this is not the same as
  responsive web page)

- Utilise user inputs to update chart in real time (\*this is not updating the
  database but only the chart in realtime).

What I will do to meet these requirements

- Aqcuire free phone csv data from Kaggle, convert the data into a database schema and extract that data to use inside the cart.

- Create a Bubble and a radar chart to plot the data (Radar for the battery comaprison , bubble for the Price vs performance) including titles, lables, legends and colours and more.

- Make the visualizations appropriately responsive, by using javscript as well utilising the taillwind framework

- Creating inputs for the user by implementing range sliders , checkboxes through a fltering sidebar , Sorting drowpdown buttons , resting the filters and applying the changes.

- Creating 4 pages, HomePage, Main dashbaord page and a phone page to display the phones.
